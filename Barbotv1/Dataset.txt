Eyesight is a gateway
To a new day and the same hate
With a new height and the same feet
On a airplane yelling, "Mayday"
With a good girl gone bad girl
Who went gay 'cause of date rape
That's a metaphor for the US
'Cause they got us all in the same state
State of mind, brain is minimized
Put me on the news, only criticize
Revolution will never be televised
For the enemy, they never empathize
And I never voted, never sugar coat it
With my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
When the fire open, let it be your moment
When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang! (Bang, bang, bang)
This for Trayvon and Tree
Burn the bush and chronic, speakin' honestly
We livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies
Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States
Talkin' about “let's make a fort"
Talkin' about “let's make it great"
If the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot
Time to run with lions on the road to Zion
In this age of violence, time to grab the iron
When I pop the silencer, it's nothing but silence when–

Uh, look, okay
Baby, I'm a fool because I thought you would stay
Whether I win or I lose, they already think we dead
But they continue to shoot, I'm just gon' cover my head
I need to duck and not move (Yeah) I bust a move when I (Uh)
Find a way to get on and get up and get out the crib
I was just looking into the mirror
Tryna dislocate my fear 'cause you broke my heart
Let me dry my tears
So serious, I'm so neglected
In the wrong direction with a long erection
Got no protection but it's fuck the world
When she bend it over, being over-sensitive
But did I mention that my real intentions
Are on me really dealin' with the consequences
And I see your tone is very condescending
When I talk to you, but no you won't admit it
And I pity the fool
Been tryna vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
Like I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
Just stop brushing me off to the side (Oh, shit)
Oh say, can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
By the dawn's early light, double Sprite and a R.I.P. tee
So proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blaow in the night time
Of the slum house, little drum bump with the one thousand
Come-come, here they come

Birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons
Soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more spartans
Lord, prophet, praise Muhammad
“Different Strokes", Philip Drummond
Gave me crack, like I'm plumbin', Jesus Christ, second comin'
Cut myself, now I'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'
Chosen one, I'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for London
Guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'
Precedent in abundance, President is a puppet
Gotta hate it, gotta love it, pass a class, I rise above it
Wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' “fuck it"
Donald Trump, Donald Duck, what the fuck is the difference?
Now we stuck, in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned
What is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition?
Not a saint, not a sinner, tell me, what's my real religion?
Genocide, Genesis, they say it's a new beginnin'
I'm a sinner, you a sinner, I can see the devil grinnin', damn

Pockets too big, they sumo

Wanna pop off the clip like hummus he dip, uh
Acrobat, with the bag, I'ma flip, uh
Money float like a damn battleship, uh

Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly
I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry"
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me

Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip

I don't do it for the clout or fame
All the real niggas gonna vouch on my name
All the real niggas gonna vouch on my
Yeah
Yeah

If you ain't got more than five top tens then I don't wanna hear no chat about chartin'
You man are just startin'
Come in like a young Chris Martin
Start swingin' with my arms like Carlton
Start swingin' with my arms like Anthony
All my niggas been charged, don't amp me
Have your missus in her bra and panty
If you see me in the dance, I'm anti, quite frankly
Heavyweight champion of the world
They wanna war me for my belt
If you ever hear Stormzy caught an L
Know I stood tall before I fell
There's a couple birthdays comin' up
So I took like a quarter from the shelf
Spent like a hundred on my mum
Then about one-forty on myself
The Mille, I sport it like Pharrell
But I got the Nautilus as well
All of the stories that I've lived, my nigga
These are the the stories that I tell

Last three tunes kinda prove that I did this
Mind what you say, I put a yout on my shit list
Must be the same old yout in the dinner hall
Primary, sippin' on my juice with my biscuits
I'm from a place where we move to da witness
Stare in your face, tell 'em, "Business is business"
Came for the fame, but she stayed for the litness
Ask your new girl, she loves Mr. Skeng
You'll never ever see me with guys known for verbals
My bruddas pull up and sky, no rehearsals
Don't switch sides, there's no role reversals
How's the best spitter in grime so commercial? Wait
Nobody said you're good, dun your chat
Your girl take the wood, lumberjack
Hit 'em with a lighter flex, humble brag
I can't drop the bag, I'm the bag

What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real ass bitch
A real ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today? (Grow it like a real-)
What are the words I'm forbidden to say? (Grow it like a real-)
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real ass bitch (Grow it like a real-)
A real ass bitch, bitch (Grow it like a real-)

My niggas takin' over
BROCKHAMPTON, call your momma
My niggas goin' platinum
Break necks, send you to the doctor
Best boy band since One Direction
Makin' niggas itch like a skin infection, mm
Did me wrong like a perfect stepson, mm
Been a wrong, you can change the song, hun

Who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, come get it from me, uh
Come get it from me, uh
Come get it from me, uh, uh, uh
Come get it from me

They be like, "What the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the pharaoh when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right now you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, light the end and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that's zoom if you just assume

Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

Uh, okay, put your fucking hands up, this the fucking anthem
Smiling 'cause I'm young, rich, black, and I'm handsome
Not to mention wealthy, ass on her healthy
Young millionaire, what the fuck can you tell me? Smell me?
Nigga, that's Chanel cologne
I'm in Europe with the tourists with no cellular phone

Like ooh, sound like rich nigga problems
I hit a bad bitch with a fistful of condoms
And the randomness of risky ménages
Like get the head right, she can get what she wanted
The spits, then flaunt it, my drip like a faucet
She told me she was prego, I ain't even take the motherfuckin' dick out my pocket, yeah

The opposite
She want me to fly her, so I copped a jet
Must be thinkin' I'm a one way ticket on a runway
Drippin' in my feng shui, sippin' on a sundae

I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
I'ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James boat
Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ayy, we like a cold team, nigga, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
Shit, I was like 16, but I can give a sixteen
I can make a bitch scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald bitch, I call her Ms. Clean
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
We party in South Beach, Ferraris and blue cheese
Fuck does that even mean? Nigga, just let the hook sing

Son of a god, son of a bitch
Son of woman and man, son of a sun, in a sunken abyss
Summon a plan, please come with a script
Cover my back, cover man, please come with the blitz
Look at the stats, J.I.D like a magician
Fuck that, this some real ass shit, I paid blood for this
Taking cheese from the government
Cereal boxes with the bugs in it
Hand me down, this my brother brother's shit
Don't compare me to no other other niggas
In the city, boy they say they fucking with you
Heebie jeebie, that's a bit disgusting but I get it
I'm full attention, full of spirit but full of shit
Standing next to Lil Tay when that bullet hit him
Shit, I miss him, I wish that that bullet missed him but it didn't
And since I been living with it like a sickness
Intimate, infinite rhymes, give me the baton
A ticking, ticking time bomb, takin' the finish line
Look alive, look in my eyes, look at you niggas tryin'
And ya dumb, dumb, better run, run 'cause we fryin' em
Eastside, where ya from, from niggas wildin'
So be silent before my niggas creep silent
With street knowledge, complete nonsense
Delete comments, online, all lies, we see violence
Every day in my eyes, they killing my niggas, die, nigga die
Pull up with the fye, get 'em nigga, it's eye for an eye
If we gotta ride, fuck it nigga, ride for the ride of ya life
Diabolical minds, I don't mind it, I like it, I like it, I love it
I fuck with you, you a thug, I'ma thug with you
We can knuck, we can buck if a nigga fuck with you
I got love for you out the mud with you, off the muscle

Poppin' but you really not gon' shoot (Pop)
90 pointers down my diamonds look like hula hoops (90)
Hopping in my Bentayga and her seat is a masseuse (Hey)
Balenciaga, check my posture, Valentino boots (Oho-ooh)
It's the Boominati way, a lotta Lambs, a lotta Wraiths (Boominati)
Never hesitate to give a nigga yellow tape (Grrt)
Ain't worried 'bout the bag 'cause the cash accumulatin' (Bags)
Soon as we came in the game, all these niggas they imitate it (Hey)
Put my mind on it then I put my grind on it (Grind)
Put the iron on him if a nigga my opponent (Iron)
My car 500 and I don't put no miles on it (Ho)
I was runnin' 'round homie, with 500 thou' on me (Ho)

Told my fam, got the gang with me (Gang with me)
Bought my first Patek, it got some rain on it (Patek)

We get at it, then we 'gone pray with the pastor's scriptures (Hey)

7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm ridin', why they on me?
Why they on me? I'm flyin', sippin' low-key
I'm sippin' low-key in Onyx, rider, rider
When I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Pop star, lil' Mariah
When I text a cute game, wildness
Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all

Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peeling more residual
(I can) buy the building, burn the building
Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more
(I can) justify my love for you
And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (Brr)

Stop all the pain
How do you stop all the pain, huh?
I used to hear a voice when I was praying
But nowadays, I don't even wanna be saved
Nah, fuck that, I don't wanna be saved
I was born to be wild, I don't wanna be tamed
Talent's in my blood and I don't wanna be vain
But if I'm a psycho, then I don't wanna be sane
I used to dream of this shit when I was hopping on train
So, so bad, I used to want all the fame
My ex-girl want to shoot a cover for Vogue
Which is pretty ironic 'cause she's top of the range
If any one of you take a shot on a track
My niggas come back and put a shot in your frame
Easy as the alphabet
Three G's in the ring, call me Alvarez
My teacher used to say I need counseling
Couldn't stop asking me, "What do you feel?"
There's so many old scars that they wanna reveal
We got off on the wrong foot 'cause I don't want him to heal, nah
But if you're looking for a psycho, you got one
I thought I had a screw loose but I lost one
Ninety-nine problems, money, it is not one
My currency's Kenyan, that's in it for the long run, huh
Tears on a pillow
Bro, I shed so many tears on a pillow
I used to tell my teachers that nobody gets it
I don't know Clarke but I know that I'm a Kidult
'Cause my mummy ain't been home, miss thinks I'm involved
Blame my environment, it made me a sicko
Furthermore, I should bring that bitch down to Streatham
And then make her spend a day in a veil like a widow
Kiddo, we seen swords longer than a limo
My bros are blacksmiths like Jaden and Willow
Man, there's weapons over here, we're reppin' over here
We're from the Southside but it's Streatham over here
No telling if you're selling, hold the wettin' over here
Get him over here, who the fuck is checkin' over here?
Most my niggas are the ones applying pressure over here
Fuck assault, I can get a nigga peppered over here, whoa
We wanted more, then some food on the strip or moving a brick
My niggas went to school with the rich and we were broke
Hiding crow in a Rubicon drink
Which is funny 'cause that's how we put food in the fridge
So, who am I?
Someone tryna live his best life
I just wanna take a pretty woman for a test drive
If I bring her to my room and I press, I
Guarantee she gonna see the force like an ex-wife
People tell me I'm a little bit barmy
For my army, I need a bottle of Bacardi
If it's me and a pouch with my dargy
Shawty, you're seeing two stars in the party
Fuck what you heard
I'm a top boy and I ain't giving man a turn
I don't wanna know a pretty woman wanna flirt
Learned you can judge a nigga by the women that he curves
I love this game, I ain't lost focus
I'm a hitmaker, if you haven't noticed
I could be the rapper with the message like you're hoping
But what's the point in me being the best if no one knows it?
Brother I'm a careful, humble, reckless, arrogant, extravagant
Nigga probably battlin' with manic depression
Man, I think I'm going mad again
It's like I'm happy for a second then I'm sad again
And to my fans, the reason I could get to this
You're my drug, the instrumental my therapist
Man, I need some therapy
My girl saying that she'll never leave
I'm scared she gonna find a better me
Deeper insecurities, like
What if I don't leave a legacy?
Money, why they check for me?
Mummy lost respect for me
I wish we could be together but that ain't how life works
I used to cry about my dad until my fucking eyes burnt
Nose running, you don't know nothing
Before I put a penny on the table, I provided for my family
Held my mother's hand through the agony, hey
You ever fall 'sleep 'cause you don't wanna be awake?
In a way, you're tired of the reality you face?
If you're thinking 'bout doing it
Suicide doesn't stop the pain, you're only moving it
Lives that you're ruining
Thoughts of a world without you in it, hiding
I ain't psycho but my life is

My brother got a new wristwatch
But don't watch that 'cause you could get
You could get nauseous, could get seasick
I mean, all of my ex-girls hate me
But how you gonna have my baby, baby?
Don't you know I'm livin' that, baby boy?
Lifestyle everyting crazy
If you don't chat to your guy, your G'll see
I ain't talkin' Mercedes, naw
Let's talk 'bout drama
I got a peng brownin' in my zone
And I'm in the zone too like Karma
Man, pull up, hop out, pull over
If it's palava, call say nada
Now I'm in the party with Tara
And that girl got body like armour
Football and Balenciagas
Or I kick ball in my all-black Pradas
No actin', never went RADA
I'm a top boy like Sully but darker
Hahaha, what's the drama?
Peng ting still get aired
Left on read then blue like Barça
If it ain't about face, don't dial me
If it ain't about face, won't answer
I got a brownin' livin' in Sydenham
Professor X 'cause truth say the back ain't there
But the brain is brilliant
And my new ting came with kids
And that's okay 'cause I am still dickin' it
Little man wanna jump on FIFA
So I'm close to the son like Icarus
Whitewash man then I'm back in the room with his ma
Tryna whitewash that for the thrill of it
No bareback, man gotta jimmy it
Backside jigglin', shakin', ripplin'
And it not just ticklin'
Tryna hide my face cah' can't stop gigglin'
Them man all hickory dickory
Watch glistenin' but the Rollie tickin', it's
It's, it's such a shame

Was it us that got a man movin'?
Don't be stupid
No bumper with a bumbah
New number, hit her back like, "Who's this?"
Cucumber in her belly like a broomstick, huh
R8 or the Lamborghini?
The man there don't plan to see me
Cah' my niggas on Greece like Santorini
I've got a brownskin girl from Bush
That will take that charge in a test' if I say so
Both hands on her wig while I hit from the back
Got me pullin' on her tracks and cane rows
Two man in a Superdry jacket and new Astra
Man, it's lookin' like plain clothes
We ain't never had halos
Just Henny and Jenny from the block, no J-Lo
This year here is gonna be a mad one
I need a good girl, I need a bad one
I need a brand new vest and a handgun
Dem man need that more than a man does
Dem man need cash more than a man does
Dem man been crashed more than a man, look
You don't wanna end up in my bad books
It's not a good look givin' man a bad look

Watch the sun now
Had a likkle beef but it's done now (It's done)
I just need a drink and a rub down
When my team's in the place, it's a shut down (Down)

I got my friends and my fam on my shoulder (On my back)
I been cold, but my money got me colder

I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)

Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Tryna compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

Santan from the V-V x AJ
Mad mystic with the pen like J.K
True say, I ain't really a drinker
But I got love for brandy like Ray J
Champagne popper, .44 chopper
In the black Nike bomber, heartbeat stopper
Half-heart MC dropper
.45 wapper, leave you in the states like Kaká

AJ from the l-l x Santan
Man's got style on the riddim like Gangnam
Two young bruddas tryna eat off of music
But we used to eat off of pebs and the sand bags
Now we get money, music money
Money that could put your girlfriend in a handbag
White tee, Balenciagas, man bag
Left-winger with a long stick like a granddad
AJ Tizzy from T-H-E lizzy
And I'm all out for the Lizzy
I don't wanna look like you, you're broke
And I've been telling broke bruddas "move" like Grizzy
Still brandy but the hand ting fizzy
Probs be in bin if a man weren't busy
I'm a mic king, I'm a king on the mic
And I'll spin bruddas til the whole scene gets dizzy

Santan Dave from the Vale and Tracey
Duck man down on the road, I'm pacey
Two lighties on the phone, so facety
One named Jordan and one named Stacey

Dust man down with a mask like Tobi
Tell a boy cotch, my man's telling me lots
But we are not Gs so don't watch my face

Ladbroke Grove is where I re- who?
Man get burst up in the G- who?
Came back with a fresh one, it's new
Don't come around for a two of the blue
I don't give a fuck if you're old or new
I'll just yawn like "blackball who?"
Put a couple dead MCs in the grave
Trust me, darg, you can go there too
Trust me, darg, you can go there free
I don't ever watch F-A-C-E
AJT from MTP
NikeLab tracksuit, Nike ID
Man got overly fucked in the beef
Pretty sure I landed a bang to his teeth
Man will get banged in the face by me
Not my bredrin, banged in the face by me

And me
Man talk tough, we'll see
Hit him with the left-right, left-right, left-right-right
One jab, then I duck, then weave
Come like Trevor from GTA
If I bang man's face, man bop, then lean
Kun Aguero, man dropped the shoulder feint once
Quick kick then I drop man's G
First time I link her, Nando's, sweet
£9.95, I swipe, then eat
I one-two rap, she don't give hat
Thiago Silva, man block, then skeet
Had man screaming "look, there's my man"
Hand in my pouch like "where? It's not me"
Hand in my pouch like "where? It's not us"
Turned to my G like "where? It's not we"
So if you get boom with the .45 long
It's a critical hit, no chance to repeat
And if you see Arge in the cut with the dip
You're pissed so quick your team should retreat
But if you see Juss in the cut with his right hand tucked
You're fucked, your team should leave, G
If you see Rapz in the back with his hand in the bag
It's mad, we came to see Ps

I only trust girls on days that don't end with a Y
Don't ask why, you can't ever see trust
Catch up, you could never keep up
Wrist froze if I ever freeze up
You know say we flex and we sex who we like
You no see the money, man, it's like you turned blind eye
Ooh, five bags that's a bad night
Ooh, we getting money now she like life
Fucked her with the blindfold, she ugly like me
She no say nothin', she just thought I was a freak
You can get a crackin' when I see you on the streets

You know that they do this for real, mama
You know that they catch and they kill, mama
You know that I'm feeling your style, mama
You know we got it locked for the whole summer

Remy in my cup got me seeing every peng ting twice
Now I'm feeling nice, no mixer, just ice
She said I'm too cold, baby, that's the ice
Free my niggas that are scrubs doing deals for the rice
You're taking pics but will you back the beef?
I'm a VIP, for real, with these stacks on me
Tryna beef with who I love, that's a catastrophe
'Cause we all came up out the mud like it's Glastonbury
Fendi on my belt match my pretty brown miss
And my Henny's super rare, that's some expensive brown piss
She said she wants tequila but I ain't about this
I don't really drink Patron when I ain't around MIST
And I hate makeup, that's your choice though
Rest assured, you can't get up in this Royce though
I'm up on all of my opps as far as points go

Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics
Bitch, I'm ultimate, ultimate
Bitch, I'm...

Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put in parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, "Is he fake? Is he real?"
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me

I give her constant dick, her consciousness won't go that way
I tell her every day, "Lady, you'll be havin' my baby"
She say, "Yee! Lil' nigga, man, you hella crazy"
I got this one little shawty, her little brother, he rap
He always askin' for a feature, I ignore him and laugh
But when I kill his sister pussy, she gon' lay in the hearse
Her kitty so fuckin' fire, shit, I gave him a verse

Uh, I got this cutie from Nigeria who takin' advantage
I hate I had to cut her off, but she just won't stop scammin'
Checked my credit card accounts and asked, "What's the amounts?"
The bitch cleared my whole shit, cashed the check, then she bounced
I found this chick in Atlanta, her elegant country grammar
Swear she bad and she bougie, she got such high standards
I got this good ol' country girl, she from North Carolina
When I'm in that vagina, I just could never decline her
I got this side chick from Chiraq
Who keep that strap and got my pack
Told her, "Bend it over while I break your back"
Watch over my shoulder, don't take no slack
Got this one girl from Texas, she shit on all of my exes
Cooked me eggs and some bacon, I give her good dick for breakfast
I even got this college girl who give immaculate head
But she just so fuckin' broke, I always Cash App her bread
And she just pledged AKA and upgraded her taste
So I fucked her line sisters, took 'em all on a date

Send me the location
This year 'bout vacations
Flight catching, train taking
Soon as my nigga off probation
Your boyfriend's on a waiting ting
Looking for one wish, on a Ray J ting
I pree'd that girl, outrageous ting
But she can't see 'cause I got shades and ting
Bare girls wanna throw shade and ting
No shade, what shade is your foundation in?
Darkest grey, the shade I'm in
49 more if your babes wants in
I had me a famous ting
Goals and tings, gains and tings
My house party a babe station
Girls wanna chase, it's a status ting

Look, playboy, I don't need a Carti
I'm captain, I lead the army
Bad ratio, I leave the party
Three Somalis creepin' on me
Your ex wavy, we tsunami
Girl from India, sweet as naani
Head so good, now I speak Gujarati
You hardly, pardon me, I'm laughing again
I assisted, man, passed to my friend
Look, money like the alphabet
If you wanna see P's, gotta pass on the ends
Came a long way from a park in the bends
To an '18 plate, man's parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I'm far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don't want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less
Juss to the right, Rapz to the left
Rj in the middle, got Cee to the death
Batch full of dogs with the 60's vets

I pull up on the block, I see everybody watching
'Cause there's diamonds on my chain
And there's diamonds on my watch
Money moves, Off-White shoes
Came straight from Virgil Abloh
I've been down, I've been low
Had my mattress on the floor
No map, North Cap, bend it up
Gyal a ring-ring my cellular
Mi 'ave big fat spliff pon me, nuh
Inna the big black Benz, pullin' up
Please tell everybody to start pulling up
'Nough champagne from the bar coming up
Party hard, make her live my life, oh

Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I'm surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all—duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet

I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme

The first nigga play, I'ma body a nigga (Ha)
I just checked my balance
I'll probably pull up to your hood
And come buy me a nigga (No cap)
You know that your ho told you that nigga crazy
Don't think that she lied to you, nigga (Bitch)
Get caught with your ho when I'm poppin' 'em both
Now they high just like Bobby and Whitney (Haa)
Say I'm the goat, act like I don't know
But fuck it, I'm obviously winnin'
Don't make me go hit the bank and take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different (Ha)
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' (Uh)
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children (Ahh, ahh)
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million (I pop)
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you (Yeah)
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' (Kiddin')
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga (Hot, hot, hot)
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas (I don't)
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out 'cause I'm gon' be done shot me a nigga (No cap)
I don't follow no bitches on IG
But all of your bitches, they follow a nigga (Ha)
And that lil' nigga ain't gon' shoot shit with that gun
He just pull it out in his pictures (Bitch, uh)

Talkin' my shit, I'ma pop that (Pop)
Got like thirty-two thousand in one of my pockets
The other one, that's where the Glock at (Glock)
You little niggas wanna be internet gangster
Man, tell all these little niggas stop that (Ha)
Been done burnt me a nigga in front of the store
Where your mammy and grandmama shop at (Bitch)
Hopped out on a whole other wave from these niggas
Let's see one of you little niggas top that
I will turn a nigga into a convertible
Push me a lil' nigga top back (Vroom)
Her boyfriend be hatin' and callin' her groupie
Just 'cause she like all my music (Ha)
She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusin'
I don't know what these niggas is thinkin' about
Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it (Bitch)
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor
'Member I used to cheat off a pretty bitch test
All the teachers, they thought I was stupid (Uh huh)
Was expectin' the box to pull up on a truck
Man, this nigga pulled up on a scooter (The fuck?)

Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switch

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

Car, automatic, I don't whip it if it's average (Woo)
And my bitch got status and your bitch cause static
Goddamn and you niggas ain't worthy (Ha)
She gon' kiss on my dick like a Hershey (Mwah)
Put it so deep, she like, “Baby don't hurt me" (Go, go)
Fuckin' rappers and athletes, she need a jersey (Go, go, oh)
Always in the club, I can't love her 'cause she thirsty (No)

And she in the backroom working, working
Fucking on my lap and she cursing, cursing (Ayy)

Make a loyal bitch unloyal (Bah)

Ayy, nigga, them ain't diamonds, that's foil
Big platinum plaques but they ain't for you (Nah)

I'm tryna get some fresh air
Hey, why you got the roof off, roof off?
You know it never rains here
Hey, you ain't gotta flash when you takin' your picture

Nine hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
(I need tint) 'Cause bomb head is non-disclosure

Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and not do fines, so fuck a fix-it ticket
You pull me over and might see one of your bitches, ahh!

You know I like it presidential (Presidential)
Stretch it out, that's a limo (That's a limo)
Pull it over, let me get behind ya ('Hind ya)

Niggas never see me comin' (Uh, superstar)
She wanna hold me like a ransom (Uh, bitch, I don't know you)
But the money keep me runnin' (Uh, but the money)

Pull up in an navigator truck, Excursion
Bad bitch on the side of me, half Persian

In my city ridin' vert to Uzi, Lil Uzi Vert
Every week another funeral, only time we go to church

I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown
Board of Education vs. Brown

Fuck a résumé and fuck a cap and gown
Fuck a background check back 'round when I get the check

Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
The poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary, G.O.A.T.​
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game

In the field like baseball, play ball, face wall when polices come
I don't rock Chanel, I rock channel
And no this ain't a purse, it's a satchel (At you)
Bless, at you, nah, I ain't sneeze
But if niggas want steam or smoke, bet I match you
Got a bullet with your name on the barrel
If hollows don't clip, you get nip like it's cat food
That dude, when I die, they gotta make a statue
Bad attitude, this ain't a purse, it's a satchel
Go to any nigga with money up in my bracket
Then I think about the state of rapping
All the freshmens in the classes
All the super seniors' mumblin' and ramblin'
Mumblin and rappin', mumble rapping?
I find it hard to find actual talent
I find it hard to find an actual challenge
I'm like Shabazz Palace's last acid hit, elaborate
Rap lab's labyrinth, word to Kodak's Black's Lazarus
"CALLDROPS" on the album skits

Ayo, I'm the channel that you watch, I'm the ammo in the Glock
Weird nigga, full suit with the sandals and the socks, stop
And based on my neck boy
You would think I hate glass homes way I'm handling the rocks
Who cast the first stone? Bitch, it's me, fuck you thought?
Real grunge nigga, I ain't got a flannel as the top
And I'm picking up guitar, strum nigga
Bum niggas wish they could make a garden shed
But they sleeping on me man like their arm is dead
I'm a wild nigga boy and you farmer bred, born
You ain't animal, you are, corn, hahah, yeah!

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (Bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "¡No más!" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (Ayy)

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

I ain't been gettin' high
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters (Facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (Facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frowned since '06, I ain't cried since '01
My pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

She said she 21, I might have to ID that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screenin' out the lane
Went from "Damn, this nigga lame" to remember my name

When I put the hoodie on, it get realer, yeah
Put a hundred thousand in my Prada jeans
Got some little homies, got some prodigies
And I spent five hundred on Prada tees
Made it out the projects, poppin' overseas
Shawty gave me sloppy toppy on the seat
I make some calls, you can't cop the fleet
Gotta be an antisocial gangster 'cause the feds watchin' my tweets

Fuck it, I ran up the numbers
Piped up like a plumber
And sold all the bundles (Sold all the bundles)
I paid off the debt to your honor
And went got some commas and commas and commas (Racks)
You let it get to your head, yeah, I remember when you was a runner (You was a runner)
I heard you got snatched by the feds, yeah, say you willin' to tell 'em whatever (Yeah)
I still be killin' in projects, even though I been runnin' them numbers up
They used to tell me I'm not next, I'm like look at me now, I'm in front of them
And I just hope you never set me up, my lifestyle too irregular
And I don't know how I'ma trust again, I swear
Audemars might fuck up your eyes, yeah
I bust down a piece of the pie, yeah
I wanna speed off in a Cayenne (Speed off in a Cayenne)
I got a cup full of Hi-Tech
Have a pool party with the posse (Pool party with the posse)
We be the talk of the topic
These fuck niggas don't where the drop at (Uh)
They won't want us ridin' in the drophead
And he mad that my bitch got a Masi'

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers."
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic)
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though)

To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

What's up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah)
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what's up, smoke)
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

(We out here)
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area (Motherfuckin' area)
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
('Fore I bury ya)
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
(Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya)
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? (Wassup?)
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap (Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat)

Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh)
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

Get it and go, stack up my dough
Bitch eat my dick like a meatball hero
Black on my body like Neo
I been had the sauce, I'm the new Tapatío
The fuck is a T.O.? Terrell Owens
Fuckin' bitches barely knowin' them
Sometimes I feel suicidal
Shout out to my nigga $crim
Bang, no Chiddy, run it up like Giddy
Better not fuck with me, Zeltron 6 Billi'
Got the rock like Milly, get cent like 50 (yeah)
Better not talk shit when I got goons with me
I got the power (Right), but I'm not a Ranger (Yeah)
Got the beat by Powers (Right) and we just made a banger

Get it and go, I'll stomp your ass to the ground
If you think you can fuck with my flow
Open the door, I do not walk through that muh'fucker
If they not talkin' no dough
I don't smoke dro, I barely drink
Pour up that coffee for niggas that sleep
Used to sell quarter of ounces of stink
I make a quarter a show if you blink
You couldn't see what I saw, now you peep
Now they on D, I hit the flea flicker
You should've seen quicker, I'ma just Ether him
I'ma just Ether him, make 'em see heater, son
I'm a say I'm the dad, niggas from Trinidad
Come with that choppa' that don't need no helipad
Hit your ass, pop pop, and now you irrelevant
Pop up the trunk and I don't mean an elephant
I'm talkin' stacks, you talkin' bricks
All of the rhymes you rap ain't legit
I catch a case, I plead the fifth
You catch a case, you bring the clique
I'm not the type to lose sleep for a bitch
I might just fuck for a week then I quit
I might just cop me a Rollie that don't lose the value
And trade in the shit for a crib

Bitch, I don't got no respect for opposition
Casket and it don't show with dirty feelings
Blood on my blunt, you get the picture
Blaze carry blades with tetanus, so don't get shot
Y'all think your Majin gettin' booed off stage
Writing books like me, you ain't on my page
Grey 5-9 apes, we sell waves
Bitch, you won't act tough with a gun in yo' face
I pull up with a red light, nigga, what's up?
Nigga tryna peel off like, "Oh shit, fuck"
When the buckshots spray, better duck or have luck
All my dogs got fed when the moon comes up
Wit' a pit bull off its leash
It's the Wardog boss, real shit
They never break, they form, stay a milli'
When the clip go off, what's up?

I just jumped back like I'm on one
Look what you did, bitch, you owe us somethin'
I'm just the guy, like just get it done
Smokin' gelato, got plenty sons
You like Juwanna Mann, I like designer fame
Tats on my chest, rep' the Zombies man
All on that bitch like a sonogram
I be that nigga, that Hall of Fame
Look at yourself, we are not the same
High as a pit like I'm on a plane
Fuckin' that bitch like they all the same
Ain't nun' with Juice
I'm drunk off the booze with a thou' on the shoes
I just won't lose, niggas is fool, swag
I'm rockin' the blue fur
I like that bitch right there, think I'm gon' like, her

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Feelin' like I'm fresh out; Boosie (Boosie)
If they want the drama, got the Uzi (Uzi)
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship (cruise)
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies (movies)
Ride with me, ride with me, boss (boss)
I got a hard head, but her ass soft (soft)
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo for 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So, you don't ever hurt nobody
Baby girl, work your body, work your body

Take chains off, take rings off
Bracelets and things, big aches and pains
My jack rang off with clickbait
Truth is too raw, it's a fish plate
Fela, the kunte
A hunnid and fifty of us on the big stage?
How long it took a nigga just to get paid?
And now I think I’m 'bout to buy a Bentley, pronto
I'm in LA with the shaker and bongo
I heard your tape, do or die, it was compo-
Trimmin' the bream with the blade and lawnmow'
Figure it out, nigga
Bitch, don't spill my sake
You gon' make me kick you out this 'partment
You gon’ have to kick it in the lobby
Damn, but don’t somebody stop me, I'm too sloppy

Pop the top, that bitch hot than a motha
We need more peace and less lone gunners
Put down your heat and smoke marijuanas
Pop the lock off your muzzle
Niggas is dyin' like lost files in the shuffle

And take them AK's up outta these inner city streets

Dear Mr. President, it's evident that you don't give a damn
Shi-tell me somethin' that I don't know
All this fuckin' evidence and if it ever make it to the stand
Shi-you know they gon' let 'em go, bro
You was overseas stealin' niggas' land and oil
Billy copped the Desert Eag' and it's legal to tote it
Lil' nigga bullied out his Pumas
But why he have to shoot the whole school up?

Nothing's safe when your numbers change
Keep it low or pay the fee
Niggas talking but it's not too often that they living what they speak
Good pussy kept me entertained
Money came then it went away
Lord see over everything (Over everything?)
Am I my brother's keeper (Am I my brother's keeper)
You know everybody gotta eat, bruh
I wanna live on ahead, if not a cloud in the air
The right side of the chair
If Jesus would've had a better lawyer would he have to see the cross
I hope your niggas is true, I hope they don't do you like Judas
I pray to God
Pain wearing off, sleeping while I talk
Laid in the arms, woke up at the top
I wanna live on ahead, if not a cloud in the air
Right side of the chair

Am I my brother's keeper, they still asking 'bout the duo
Applaud his finding salvation
But I'm still rhyming 'bout the you know
It's hard to leave your foundation, this spaceship took me to Pluto
Still an underground king, but the money's Jason Derulo
Sumo in the safe, Cujo on the grill
Diamonds in the face, racing leather wheel
To all my other field niggas, you knowin' how I feel, niggas? (Woo)
Destroy and rebuild niggas
That's the only way to build nigga, yuugh
Definition of a real nigga
And the target, it ain't to kill niggas, no

And I keep a Patek, too, 'cause I don't do facades
You see my diamonds even when I'm in the dark
And since you got it, it make you go and do anything you want to

Stolen 'peds, that's Geely and Vespas
And the feds called my broski restless
Said he got a charge in the car, no Tesla
And everybody 'round me rowdy
I walk in, tell the jeweler, "Wow me"
If you're talkin' 'bout P's just 'low me
19, I put 19 on an Audi
I'll never forget that day that I found me the cutest caramel brownie
And the chest and back both bouncy
Trust me, everyting shake, no Saudi
My G just came out for a shooting
And Ramz done a madness, charting
Say that man got something in common
'Cause trust me, both of their tings been barking
If you see him at a drinkup, park him
Do it like Jordan, run up and spark him
My G's been on badness, way before they had a moustache like Stalin
And this ting's all love and hate, 'cause a lot of man love to hate
My young G done draws and eights
Now he's cuttin' through bricks like the 1-1-8
And I ain't on indirects, diss me, and I take that personal
How you gassed off a note that's purple?
Bet you never got it off white like Virgil
Two men and an angry Merc
That's war wit' a German, Winston Churchill
It's mad when man wanna murk you
But you know you gotta be in by curfew
And I seen a lot of man get pressured, why?

Mitcham Lane, that's Streatham and Tooting
I'm in East tryna link my girl
'Cause I've got a baby, a crossbow like Cupid
Man are dead or in jail, that's useless
Tell a yute, "If you've got a brain, then use it"
Now I drive past man I went school with
You was the cool kid, now you look clueless
And I'm still tryna tell man, "Fuck the Audi, switch it for a Benz"
When you're tryna make it out the ends
Friends of enemies are enemies
And enemies of enemies are friends
Fuck the Benz, I switch it for a Beamer
Tell the dealer, "Need a bigger litre"
He told me he's on me when he sees me
I barely remember why we're beefin'

Look, black is beautiful, black is excellent
Black is pain, black is joy, black is evident
It's workin' twice as hard as the people you know you're better than
'Cause you need to do double what they do so you can level them
Black is so much deeper than just African-American
Our heritage been severed, you never got to experiment
With family trees, 'cause they teach you 'bout famine and greed
And show you pictures of our fam on their knees
Tell us we used to be barbaric, we had actual queens
Black is watchin' child soldiers gettin' killed by other children
Feelin' sick, like, "Oh shit, this could have happened to me"
Your mummy watchin' tellin' stories 'bout your dad and your niece
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news
And if he's white you give him a chance, he's ill and confused
If he's black he's probably armed, you see him and shoot

Look, black is growin' up around the barbershop
Mummy sayin', "Stay away from trouble, you’re in yard a lot"
Studying for ages, appreciatin' the chance you got
'Cause black is in your blood, and you ain't even got the heart to stop
Black is steppin' in for your mother because your father's gone
And standin' by your children when you haven't proven karma wrong
Black is doin' all of the above then goin' corner shoppin'
Tryna help a lady cross the road to have her walkin' off
Black is growin' up around your family and makin' it
Then being forced to leave the place you love because there's hate in it
People say you fake the shit, never stayed to change the shit
But black is bein' jealous, you'd be dead if you had stayed in it
Black is strugglin' to find your history or trace the shit
You don't know the truth about your race 'cause they erasin' it
Black has got a sour fuckin' flavour, here's a taste of it
But black is all I know, there ain't a thing that I would change in it

Look, black ain't just a single fuckin' colour, man there's shades to it
Her hair's straight and thick but mine's got waves in it
Black is not divisive, they been lyin' and I hate the shit
Black has never been a competition, we don't make this shit
Black is deadly
Black is when you're freezin' in your home and you can't get sleep but never feelin' empty
'Cause you got 20 cousins in your country living stress-free
Walkin' for their water, daughter wrapped inside a bed sheet
Black is distant, it's representin' countries that never even existed while your grandmother was livin'
Black is my Ghanaian brother readin' into scriptures
Doin' research on his lineage, findin' out that he's Egyptian
Black is people namin' your countries on what they trade most
Coast of Ivory, Gold Coast, and the Grain Coast
But most importantly to show how deep all this pain goes
West Africa, Benin, they called it slave coast
Black is so confusin', 'cause the culture? They're in love with it
They take our features when they want and have their fun with it
Never seem to help with all the things we know would come with it
Loud in our laughter, silent in our sufferin'
Black is bein' strong inside and facing defeat
Poverty made me a beast, I battled the law in the streets
We all struggled, but your struggle ain't a struggle like me
Well how could it be when your people gave us the odds that we beat?
I mean, fuckin' hell, what about our brothers that are stuck in jail?
That couldn't bust a bell, they held a bird and gotta live with it
Black is bein' guilty until proven that you're innocent
Black is sayin', "Free my fucking niggas stuck inside in prison cells"
They think it's funny, we ain't got nothin' to say to them
Unconditional love is strange to them; it's amazin' 'em
Black is like the sweetest fuckin' flavour, here's a taste of it
But black is all I know, there ain't a thing that I would change in it

Man try say he's better than me

All of my ex-girls stalking me hard

Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wantin' them to see me? I

Okay, this song right here remind me of my ex
Say I be declinin' all her calls and I don't respond to none of her texts
I be like, "Girl, hush your mouth, you know I ain't got time for nothin' but sex"
She know I injured my right hand so when I get behind I use my left
She watched that "Walker Texas Ranger," say I remind her of Nas X
I'm talkin' "Old Town Road," all my hoes down low
They like girls and I like girls, three at a time, sometimes four
And if my backend not all hundreds and ain't on time, then I don't go
I be like...

If you ever want for anything to work, you gotta try
You gotta live like you dying in a minute, take your time
Use it wise, dream higher than "The Ribbon in the sky"
Don't gotta take my advice, you know, who the fuck am I? (Yeah, who the fuck are you?)
But just a little fly, finding smells through a shitty walk of life
Or Walter Payton on the sideline, the pie line is mine
In my mind, I try to see myself through God eyes
Fuck a guideline or tour guide, nobody helped me, but I’m not fine
God got me, but if not, then this nine got me
Nah, Akhi, this bird shit, you pop cocky
I gotta get the mop, they tryna leave the boy sloppy
Slip once then it's my fault, second time, then you got me fucked up
Tried ending it and knock me off my rocker, tough luck
Kick my ass, let me run it back, that was tough love I was raised on
Bad kid hittin' chained dogs with the acorns, East Atlanta playboy

It’s about to be five, I gotta grab Syx at seven o'clock
Hopped on a plane, then in a drop
I stick a car seat inside of a car that it ain't supposed to be in
Young, black king ducking the hoes in my DM's
I was cruising down Moreland couple years ago
I was broke, but I knew blood, sweat, and tears, you know?
I thought I knew it all but I didn't know a thing
Ain't scared of the cold, bitch, I got ice in my veins
I looked up to God, she look up to me, smile, thumbs up, right on
How I'm supposed to slide when my check engine light on?
Bought a whole crib long way from Double Trees
Nickname her Chanel and I love her double C's
JID told me, "Get ’em," I said, "It’s gon' be a breeze"
Talk slick shit ’cause I got VV's in my teeth
I took us from EBT to Amex (Right spot)
From dreams of BET to the Grammys (Yeah)

You hold me down like four flats
Let me drive the 'Lac to get some food, couldn't pay you back
Though I offer gas money every time, you say take it back
Heard word around town that you been askin’ 'bout me
But that's surprisin' 'cause last time we spoke
You told me life was better off without me
Damn, that's deep, cut me deep
I let the pain seep 'cause that makes for good music
It don't hurt to check to see how you doin'
You watch my stories, so you know how I'm doin'
Don't be no ghost, watching all my posts but don't like a picture
Swear, I miss you but it's yo' fault that a nigga ain't with you
See, we had plans, sell my two-seater for a sedan
Call your daddy just to ask for your hand
But you was playin' (Yeah, yeah)

I could make a flash from a little piece of plastic
Throw the peace sign, better call the pediatrics
Or read Ecclesiastes, I'm cleaning up the cat fleas
I'm working on my back swing, they coming at my back attacking
A tackle, a technical foul, travel
Babbling Babylon, brother, you ready for battle?
And, bitch, your bottom butler buddy getting blacked on
If he act wrong, get your motherfucking strap on
Leave your gat home, no Taxstone, brap-brap at your hat
Send me up to Sing Sing for that
If I miss you, I got niggas I could ring-ring for that
Shoot the picture, if I get you, I'ma get you, when I get you, I'ma get you, Jack
I'm kickin' back thinkin' how these niggas tried to hate me
In the rear view mirror like, "Are y'all serious?"
I'ma pull up on niggas and need just my littles
But these be the killers for real (Yeah)

They hatin', they stankin', they waitin'

Lord, I'm on fire, they think that I'm Satan
Callin' me crazy on different occasions
Kickin' the cameraman off of my stages
'Cause I don't like how he snappin' my angles
I'm overboard and I'm over-impatient
Over my niggas and these kids my ages
Dealin' with Mo' shit that's more complicated
Like these two bitches that might be related
H-Town, you got one, and you Bun B like a number one
It's late night, got a late show
If you wanna roll, I got a place where, ahh
